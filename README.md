## NumberGuess

* React-Native Expo Project

User chooses a number to start the game. The phone then tries to guess what the number you choose is. After each guess you give the phone a hint on whether it needs to guess higher or lower. All computer guesses are displayed in a list to the user. Once the computer finally guesses the users number, the game over screen is shown with how many rounds it took the computer to guess.
